# Blockchain
Private Blockchain made in golang

Using this blockchain is simple. Run the program and the server will star on port 8080 on localhost or you can send in the port you would like as an argument.

After that you can go to localhost:8080 in your browser and see your genesis block.
From there you can go to localhost:8080/start to start mining
Multiple miners can mine at the blockchain at a time.
There are also other routes such as localhost:8080/show
Here is a video demonstrating the process
